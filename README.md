Error: Sentry CLI binary for this platform/architecture not found!

It seems like none of the "@sentry/cli" package's optional dependencies got installed. Please make sure your package manager is configured to install optional dependencies. If you are using npm to install your dependencies, please don't set the "--no-optional" or "--omit=optional" flags. Sentry CLI needs the "optionalDependencies" feature in order to install its binary.
